If you read our Medium article, you'll know there is a very special symbiotic relation between the largest and smallest of creatures in the ocean: Whales and Diatoms.

Such is also the case in the crypto world. Whales provide large amounts of liquidity, while the large army of smaller holders provides stability, feedback and spreads the word. 

So, we set out to create a launch strategy the equally rewarded DAO members of all sizes, while staying close to the successful playbook pioneered by OlympusDAO (OHM) and KlimaDAO (KLIMA). 

So, here it is, our proposed launch strategy. We're sharing this in our public channels to ask for feedback, criticism and concerns before it's becomes the official decision.

This is a DAO, after all ðŸ™‚

The launch will happen in 4 stages: 

- 1 Whalez NFT Sale
- 2 Diatoms NFT Sale
- 3 Copperlaunch LBP
- 4 Bonding + Staking 


Before you read on, it's important for you to understand the difference between pDIAT and DIAT. 

Like KLIMA and OHM before us, we're using a token called pDIAT to compensate the team, investors, advisors and partners on a vesting scheduled dependent on total token supply of DIAT.

As the token supply increases, more pDIAT is automatically claimable, and able to be converted into DIAT. 

We're excited to announce that we'll be the first OHM fork to offer this token tier to early supporters as well.

Both NFT sales will reward the buyers with an allocation of pDIAT. Buying one of these NFT's makes you an official investor in Diatom, so pDIAT will be claimable in perpetuity as Diatom grows, giving you a forever-stake in the success of this DAO. 

We think this is a brilliant mechanism to ensure early backers of the project are aligned with the long-term success of Diatom, and to prevent rugs that are becoming more common in the OHM fork space.

pDIAT will be allocated as follows, with 'supply share' meaning the % of the total token supply that will constantly be matched by pDIAT available to be claimed: 

Team: 7.5% supply share
Partners: 1% supply share
Advisors: 0.5% supply share
OlympusDAO: 1.50% supply share
Klima DAO: 1.50% supply share
Whalez NFT Buyers: 3% supply share
Diatom NFT Buyers: 1% supply share

So, in total, all early stakeholders will never have more than 16% of the total supply. 

And yes, we're allotting tokens to both OHM and KLIMA as a thank you for laying the groundwork for Diatom ðŸ™‚


**1) Whalez NFT Sale**

50 Whalez NFT's will be auctioned one-at-a-time over the course of 2 weeks (like Nouns and SquidDAO). 

Buyers will be allocated pDIAT pro-rata based on their % contribution relative to the total amount raised in the sale.

So, if you purchase one Whalez for $100,000, and the total amount raised was $10M, you would get 1% of the 3% allocation, or .03% of the total token supply in pDIAT.

The funds will provide capital to  fund the first ocean plastics removal by our partners to provide initial liquidity of PRC.

Whalez will be different in that the auctions will be shorter over time. The first auction will be 24 hours long, then each subsequent auction will decrease in duration to fit perfectly within the 2 weeks auction period.


**2) Diatom NFT Sale (Whitelist Required)**

Not everyone is a Whale. We want to fairly allow members of all sizes to invest early in Diatom. So, we're also launching a Diatom NFT that grants an allocation of pDIAT as well. This ensures the entire community is aligned in holding DIAT for the long haul.

Diatom buyers will be allocated a pro-rata amount of 1% pDIAT allocation based on a cap of $3M.

Diatom NFT's limited to one purchase per whitelisted wallet address. 

There are 3 price tiers to accommodate different sizes Diatoms: 

$500
$2000
$5000 

So, if you purchase one for $5000, you will receive .167% of the 1% allocation, which equals .0167% of the total DIAT supply. 


**3) Token Sale**

We'll be using Copperlaunch to create the first liquidity pool for DIAT, using the underlying Liquidity Bootstrapping Pool (LBP) mechanism.

Copperlaunch allows us to set a minimum and maximum price for DIAT using weights. Then the price fluctuates throughout the auction based on demand. If more people are buying, the prices goes up, and vice-versa.

We're still deciding on the weights and max cap for the auction, and will share these details in Discord as soon as possible.

4) Bonding + Staking

Immediately after the LBP, staking goes live and we launch the first bonds. More details on bonds and staking APY to come.
