After much deliberation, we've decided to choose Polygon (MATIC) as our blockchain!!!

It came down to Polygon & Avalanche, since we wanted full EVM-compatibility, full decentralization (sorry BSC!), cheap transactions and low carbon impact (power consumption of the consensus mechanism). 

There are 2 major benefits of using Polygon that convinced us to choose it over Avalanche (which did win our Twitter poll!):

1. The ability to easily partner with KLIMA without bridging assets
2. CopperLaunch supporting Polygon

We saw these as big enough reasons to go with Polygon. 

The ðŸ’±â”ƒtokenomics channel seems very pleased with this decision. We hope you are too 

P.S. Don't worry, the NFT sale will still happen on Ethereum!
