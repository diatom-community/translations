Hellllllo @everyone 

Now that we have our whitelist plan fully decided, it's time for the first whitelist contest  

In prep for the Whalez NFT sale, we want to light this Discord on fire and get up to 10k Diatoms! 

So, we're doing an invite contest. The first 100 people to invite 4 people to Discord get whitelist status. 

To invite, create a custom invite link by going to settings and clicking either 'Invite' or 'Invite People' depending on if you're on mobile or desktop. 

Then go to #invites and type '/invites' to check how many people have joined via your inite. Once you hit 4, we'll give you the whitelist role automatically. 

Let's goooooooo!

Holy crap guys. That was insane. We want from 3k to 5.2k in 30 minutes. 

Don't you worry, this is only the first whitelist contest! 

Let's keep this invite stream going! 

The next 100 people who have 8 invites will be whitelisted.

Like last time, use '/invites' in üíå‚îÉinvites to check your count. If you hit 8, we'll give you the role.

Please be patient on this one, we're going to start from the top of the üíå‚îÉinvites channel to make sure we didn't miss anyone. So, it will likely take 30 min or so for you to get whitelist once you hit 8. 

And if you hit 4 and didn't get whitelist, we're going back to check if you were missed before we hit 100. 

Thanks for your amazing support, and patience ‚ù§Ô∏è 
It's come to our attention that the invite link button is broken for many people due to the server crashing. We're looking into how to fix this. Please stand by.

Hey @everyone !

It appears our TIDAL WAVE of invites was too much for Discord! We officially crashed the server. 

Generating invite links is broken, and we don't know when it will come back online. To ensure that everyone has a fair chance for this invite contest, we've decided to postpone part 2 of this invite contest. 

In the meantime, we'll be going through the ‚îÉinvites channel up until the crash to ensure we didn't miss anyone.

IMPORTANT: Many of you have been with us for weeks now, and are seeing brand new people get whitelisted. We see you and hear your frustration. We're hatching a full plan with our moderation team to enable people who were very active early on to be whitelisted. Please stay tuned for information on that. You are loved, and have not been forgotten.

Now, for all Diatoms, there will be plenty more opportunities to get on the whitelist, and it will be much larger than just 200 people  

Stay tuned for more opportunities to get whitelisted! They'll be more fun than simply inviting people going forward  

Thank you again for the big wave of support! 

P.S. Please bear with our mods, who are being hammered with DM's and messages. We're trying to keep up.
