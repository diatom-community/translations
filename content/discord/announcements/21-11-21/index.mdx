Happy Sunday @everyone!

What a wild weekend in this Discord. It feels like we moved into a totally new epoch of the Diatom story. CryptoTwitter and the internet at large is now taking notice of what, just a week ago, was a small project in the crypto-sphere.

There will be some growing pains here as new people stream in, and our team adapts to handling this DAO at new levels of scale. 

AND, this is exactly what we collectively want. Why? 

Because 11 million tonnes of plastic enter our oceans every year.

Let that sink in. 

What we're doing here is the first collective attempt at solving a problem that the entire human population is creating daily. We need SERIOUS scale to be able to make a dent. Or a splash. Please remember that this is about much bigger things than getting on a whitelist, or maximizing returns.

And even if you do only care about maximizing returns -- we need scale for that as well. That's the beauty of this project -- the money incentives are fully aligned with the ocean protection mission. We can't have one without the other. 

This is the essence of Web3, and the promise of crypto. And we're thrilled to be on the cutting edge of this new type of alignment that has never before been possible.

With that said, welcome to all the brand new Diatoms, and thank you to all the OG's who are still with us weeks into this adventure 

As you know, we crashed the server yesterday. I personally just got back the ability to create invite links! 

The moderator channels have been abuzz with discussion on how to apply the mindset of a "fair launch" also to the process of whitelisting people. Our plan is almost fully hatched, and it's as awesome and unique as the pre-sale NFT for pDIAT concept that this whitelist is all for. 

Please be patient as we perfect this plan, and bring on more mods to make sure we're ready for the wave of activity this is going to unleash. 

It's going to be fun
