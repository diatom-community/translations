Diatoms! 

Sorry for the radio silence these past few days. We've been working non-stop on Diatom, including: 

 The full website, which will be live this week  
 Medium articles (the first one is live!)
 A teaser video for Diatom that will be great for ya'll to share with friends
 Talking to tokenomics experts to solidify our version of the OHM system
 Talking to our existing ocean cleanup partners to get what we need for our version of the Toucan Bridge for PRC

We are SO appreciative about the eager community that has joined this server asking great questions. We were not expecting such overwhelming early interest in Diatom!

As eager as we are too, we are first and foremost committed to make Diatom as solid as possible so it can fulfill its mission over the long term.

As such, we will roll out the launch in stages. The first stage will be our “Whalez” NFT sale to start building the Diatom Treasury which will help us insure liquidity. It is still going to happen this month and the date will be announced very soon.

Diatom is a DAO that doesn't just live in a codebase, but makes a real and measurable difference out there in the world. The most significant actions happening behind the scenes are partnerships with a variety of plastic cleanup partners around the globe who will be central to the highest levels of standard for the PRC. We will be rolling out specific partnerships over the coming weeks, but here are some exciting partnerships in the works: 

 Deploying river systems that catch ocean-bound plastic
 Funding mid-ocean expeditions
 Purchasing vessels for year-round cleanups
 Building local collection facilities

All of these partnerships are being vetted by renowned scientists, oceanographers, innovators and researchers to ensure we meet the highest standards, and build a long-term framework for PRC mapping into the new plastic credit framework developed by the world's leading certification organization, Verra.

That's it for now. We'll be better about sharing updates going forward!
