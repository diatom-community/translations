Hello @everyone!

We have some major announcements today!

1) The Whalez NFT sale is officially scheduled to launch this Sunday, Nov 28th at 12pm EST

It's finally here! The auctions will take place at the top of our homepage (https://diatom.fund/) and will run for 2 weeks, one NFT at a time. We've been stirring up interest in whale groups for some time, so anticipate a feeding frenzy, and a huge amount of marketing power for Diatom through this sale 

2) OG roles + 48hr Whitelist Application for early Diatoms
We saw a huge surge in Discord recently, and before we move ahead with our general whitelist bounties, we want to give very early Diatoms the ability to apply for whitelisting. 

If you were in the first 2000 in Discord, you now have an 'OG' role and you can see this channel: #â˜€â”ƒearly-diatoms. 

If and ONLY IF you have been extremely active in Discord, please post an entry in that channel about how you have personally contributed and went out of your way to help the project. We will be manually going through your full message history, and granting whitelist to those who have kicked ass for us since Day 1. 

This channel will be closed after 48 hours. Then we'll proceed again with opportunities for all Diatoms to be whitelisted.

3) Diatom NFT Sale Discussion
For those paying attention to the ðŸš€â”ƒlaunch-plan-discussion, the proposed compensation structure of the whitelisted Diatom NFT sale is being hotly debated. As of now, it's looking like a switch to using discounted DIAT rather than a pDIAT allocation is preferred by the community. We're now putting together an alternative plan that allows for this to present to the DAO. Please be patient while we have the requires info we need to make an informed decision.

Note: If anyone can connect us directly to someone from the OHM policy team, that would be highly appreciated  

Thank you everyone for the overwhelming support!

P.S. Here's one more Whalez NFT just for fun...
