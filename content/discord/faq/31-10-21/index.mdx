## What is Diatom DAO?

Diatom is a DAO on the Polygon (MATIC) network that leverages the power of staking and bonding pioneered by OlympusDAO to fund highly-vetted ocean conservation projects, including the first ever tokenization of ocean plastic removal. 

Holders of our governance token, DIAT, will be able to suggest and vote on Diatom DAO proposals using Snapshot.

Our first project will be tokenizing "plastic removed from the ocean" in the form of PRC's (Plastic Removal Credits), similar to Carbon Credits. A percentage of the funds from our NFT sale and IDO will go to funding ocean plastic cleanup, which will it turn mint PRC's into our treasury.

We will be using the most rigorous standards possible for PRC so that they're backward compatible with whatever becomes the global standard in the future (either through Verra, or another organization). 


### When is the launch?

First, 50 "Whalez" NFTâ€™s will be auctioned one at a time across a 7 day period. The first auction will last 24 hours, then each auction will decrease in duration to perfectly fit 50 in 7 days. The purpose is to jumpstart our treasury, and bring more attention to Diatom. In addition to receiving an NFT, the winner of each auction will also be retroactively given DIAT.

Then, we will launch our PRC Bridge that allows our vetted ocean cleanup partners to submit verified plastic removal in order to mint PRC. This will closely model the Toucan Bridge that is used to mint BCT for our friends over at KLIMA. 

Next, our IDO will allow whitelisted Diatom supporters the ability purchase DIAT. The purpose is to establish the first liquidity pool, and to allow our supporters who were unable to purchase an NFT to participate.

Finally, we'll launch bonding & staking on our web app. 

Note: This is subject to change as our dev team can only move so quickly!

### Where to buy DIAT? 

Upon launch, DIAT will be available through bonds on our website, as well as through DEX's.


### What will be DIATâ€™s price at launch?

The initial price of DIAT will be determined by a fair-launch IDO.


### What will the initial APY be?

TBD, but rest assured it will be Olympus-level high ðŸ™‚
